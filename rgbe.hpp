/* This file contains code to read and write four byte rgbe file format
 developed by Greg Ward.  It handles the conversions between rgbe and
 pixels consisting of floats.  The data is assumed to be an array of floats.
 By default there are three floats per pixel in the order red, green, blue.
 (RGBE_DATA_??? values control this.)  Only the mimimal header reading and 
 writing is implemented.  Each routine does error checking and will return
 a status value as defined below.  This code is intended as a skeleton so
 feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

 (Place notice here if you modified the code.)
